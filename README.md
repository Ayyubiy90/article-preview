## My Process 🛠️

### Built With

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla JavaScript for interactivity

### What I Learned 🧠

This project reinforced my understanding of responsive design and helped me improve my skills in creating interactive components. I learned how to effectively use CSS transforms and transitions to create smooth animations for the share options.

```css
.share-options {
  transition: transform 0.3s ease-in-out;
  transform: translateY(100%);
}

.share-active .share-options {
  transform: translateY(0);
}
```

### Continued Development 🚀

In future projects, I aim to:
- Explore more advanced CSS techniques like CSS Grid
- Improve accessibility features
- Implement more complex JavaScript functionalities

### Useful Resources 📚

- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/) - An invaluable resource for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript references.
- [CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/) - Great for learning about Flexbox and other CSS techniques.
